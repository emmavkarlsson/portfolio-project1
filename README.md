**Future features**
<ul>
<li>The services section could be improved by making the images more visible. As per today, the images are barely visible as I chose to prioritize the description being easy to read by using a heavy overlay. This could be solved by only showing the text header, and then provide more information about the service when the user hovers over the service while increasing the opacity of the overlay. Example shown below:</li>
<img src="docs/readme_10.png">
<li>As per today, the service boxes are enlarged when hovering. Future features could include linking the boxes to other pages of the website, explaining the services further and providing examples.</li>
</ul>
